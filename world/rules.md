# Rules

*What counts as winning, how to track progress, and what limits you.*

---

## Outcome

**PMF** — pull, retention, word of mouth (the win)

---

## Signals

The dashboard. Track these to know if you're moving toward PMF.

| Signal | What it measures | Measure |
|--------|------------------|---------|
| **Learn** | Are we getting smarter? | Experiments / Insights |
| **Reach** | Are people seeing us? | Impressions / Views |
| **Users** | Are we growing + satisfied? | # of users, NPS |
| **Depth** | Are they going deep? | Quests / Workflows |
| **Monetization** | Are they paying? | Revenue / Conversions |

Learn → Reach → Users → Depth → Monetization → **PMF**

---

## Constraints

- **Solo founder** — one person's time and energy
- **Bootstrapped** — no runway, revenue = survival
- **Building on hyperscaler rails** — their APIs, their rules, their pricing
- **Attention is finite** — you have to earn every eyeball
- **The window is closing** — urgency is real
