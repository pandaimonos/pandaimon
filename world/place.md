*The territory — Consumer AI and its characteristics.*

## Consumer AI

The space where everyday people meet AI tools.

**Characteristics:**

1. **Wide but shallow.** Hundreds of millions use AI, but most are stuck at surface level — real implementation is rare.

2. **The gap.** Insiders are racing ahead — most of the world is still catching up, confused, or unaware.

3. **Rising distrust.** The common population is growing suspicious of AI — fear, confusion, and backlash are building.

4. **Moat reality.** Sustainable moats are users, data, and workflows — not features, not code.
