# Conditions

*Macro forces — the weather everyone faces.*

---

1. **Intelligence explosion.** Intelligence compounds daily — new capabilities, new products, constant flux.

2. **Agents rising.** AI can now do the work of people — and the gap closes weekly.

3. **Solo leverage.** Building is cheap — one person with AI can now do what teams used to.

4. **Hyperscaler dominance.** Nvidia, Google, OpenAI, Anthropic control the rails — infrastructure, models, distribution.

5. **Attention wars.** Attention is scarce and volatile — things ignite fast, fade faster, obscurity kills.

6. **The window.** AI is concentrating power — escape the permanent underclass while the ladder is still down.
