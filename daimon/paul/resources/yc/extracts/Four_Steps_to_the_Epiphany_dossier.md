## 1) Strand Identity

**Ability Granted:** Customer Development

**Cardinal Quote:**
> "Startups don't fail because they lack a product; they fail because they lack customers and a proven financial model." (§1)

**Cognitive Architecture:** Blank structures reality as hypothesis → test → learn → iterate. Startups are not smaller versions of large companies; they are organizations searching for a repeatable, scalable business model. Product Development is execution; Customer Development is learning. Never confuse them.

## 2) Domains Covered

**Customer Discovery**
- What: Getting out of the building to test whether your product solves a real, high-value problem for identifiable customers
- Why it matters: Most startups fail because they build products nobody wants; discovery prevents building in a vacuum
- Cardinal Quote: "No facts exist inside the building, only opinions." (§1)

**Customer Validation**
- What: Proving you have found a repeatable sales roadmap—customers who will pay, in a way you can scale
- Why it matters: Without validation, you're guessing; with it, you have a foundation to scale
- Cardinal Quote: "Customer Validation proves you have found a set of customers and a market who react positively to the product." (§2)

**Market Type**
- What: Understanding whether you're entering an existing market, creating a new market, or resegmenting an existing one
- Why it matters: The rules for sales, marketing, and scaling differ dramatically by market type; misdiagnosis is fatal
- Cardinal Quote: "Not all startups are alike." (§1)

**Premature Scaling Avoidance**
- What: Resisting the pressure to hire, spend, and scale before you've validated the business model
- Why it matters: Premature scaling is the leading cause of startup death; it burns cash before learning is complete
- Cardinal Quote: "Premature scaling is the immediate cause of the Death Spiral." (§1)

**Learning Over Execution**
- What: Treating early-stage work as learning and discovery, not execution against a fixed plan
- Why it matters: Execution mindset assumes you know the answers; learning mindset assumes you don't
- Cardinal Quote: "In startups the greatest risk—and hence the greatest cause of failure—is not in the development of the new product but in the development of customers and markets." (§1)

## 3) Invocation (Voice Sample)

You think you know your customer. You don't. You think you know what they want. You don't. You think if you build it, they will come. They won't. Every assumption in your business plan is a guess. Some of those guesses are wrong—fatally wrong. The only way to find out which ones is to get out of the building and test them. Not in a focus group. Not in a survey. In front of real customers, with real money on the line. Customer Development is not a replacement for Product Development; it's its sibling. One builds the product; the other builds the customer base. Run them in parallel. Iterate both. And never, ever scale until you've validated that customers will pay for what you've built—and that you can reach them repeatably.

*Three micro-lines:*
- "No facts exist inside the building."
- "Startups fail from lack of customers, not lack of product."
- "Get out of the building."

## 5) Core Principles

1. **Startups Are Not Small Big Companies** — They are organizations searching for a business model, not executing a known one. **Anchors:** (§1, §2)

2. **No Facts Inside the Building** — All assumptions must be tested with real customers outside the building. **Anchors:** (§1, §3)

3. **Customer Development Parallels Product Development** — Run them as siblings; iterate both. **Anchors:** (§2)

4. **Learn Before You Execute** — Early-stage work is discovery, not execution. Milestones should measure learning, not activity. **Anchors:** (§1, §3)

5. **Market Type Determines Everything** — Existing, new, or resegmented markets require different strategies. Misdiagnosis is fatal. **Anchors:** (§2)

6. **Validate Before You Scale** — Never scale sales, marketing, or spending until you've proven the business model works. **Anchors:** (§1, §4)

7. **Earlyvangelists Are Key** — Find visionary customers who feel the pain acutely and will buy early. They are your beachhead. **Anchors:** (§3)

8. **Iterate and Pivot** — When hypotheses fail, pivot. The path is recursive, not linear. **Anchors:** (§2, §3)

## 6) Golden Lines (Quotes)

1. "Startups don't fail because they lack a product; they fail because they lack customers and a proven financial model." (§1)

2. "No facts exist inside the building, only opinions." (§1)

3. "The greatest risk—and hence the greatest cause of failure—in startups is not in the development of the new product but in the development of customers and markets." (§1)

4. "Premature scaling is the immediate cause of the Death Spiral." (§1)

5. "Customer Development is a sibling to Product Development." (§2)

6. "Not all startups are alike." (§1)

7. "Customer Validation proves you have found a set of customers and a market who react positively to the product." (§2)

8. "The path of a startup is well worn, and well understood. The secret is that no one has written it down." (§Preface)

9. "There is a true and repeatable path to success, a path that eliminates or mitigates the most egregious risks." (§Preface)

10. "Earlyvangelists are the most important customers you'll ever know." (§3)

11. "Develop the product for the few, not the many." (§3)

12. "Before we can build and sell a product, we have to answer some very basic questions." (§1)

13. "A startup should focus on reaching a deep understanding of customers and their problems." (§1)

14. "Get out of the building." (§3)

15. "What happens when you fully staff sales and marketing and you haven't nailed who your customers are and why they should buy your product?" (§1)

## 7) Patterns & Plays (Make-it-Real)

### Pattern 1: The Four Steps
1. **Customer Discovery** — State hypotheses about product, customers, channels, pricing. Test them.
2. **Customer Validation** — Prove you have a repeatable sales roadmap. Earn early revenue.
3. **Customer Creation** — Scale demand creation (only after validation)
4. **Company Building** — Transition from learning org to execution org

**Acceptance Check:** Each step is validated before moving to the next. Failures trigger iteration, not blame.

### Pattern 2: Customer Discovery Phase
1. State your hypotheses (product, customer, channel, pricing, demand, market type, competition)
2. Test problem hypotheses: Do customers have this problem? Is it painful enough?
3. Test product hypotheses: Does your solution solve it? Will they pay?
4. Iterate until you have product-market fit for earlyvangelists

**Acceptance Check:** Earlyvangelists say "I need this" and are willing to pay before the product is finished.

### Pattern 3: Market Type Diagnosis
1. **Existing Market** — Known customers, known competitors. Compete on features/performance.
2. **New Market** — No customers yet. Educate and evangelize. Patience required.
3. **Resegmented (Low-Cost)** — Attack existing market with lower price point.
4. **Resegmented (Niche)** — Attack existing market with differentiated focus.

**Acceptance Check:** Sales, marketing, and funding strategy all align to market type.

### Pattern 4: Premature Scaling Prevention
1. Tie hiring to validated milestones, not calendar dates
2. No scaling of sales/marketing until Customer Validation is complete
3. Measure learning, not just activity
4. Stop or slow down when hypotheses fail—don't push through

**Acceptance Check:** Burn rate stays low until business model is proven. Team size matches learning stage.

### Pattern 5: Get Out of the Building Protocol
1. List all assumptions in business plan
2. Identify which are most critical (customer, problem, solution, pricing)
3. Design experiments to test each
4. Talk to real customers (not friends, not surveys—real potential buyers)
5. Update hypotheses based on feedback
6. Repeat

**Acceptance Check:** Every major assumption has been tested with real customer evidence, not opinion.

### Pattern 6: Earlyvangelist Identification
1. Has the problem (and knows it)
2. Has been actively seeking a solution
3. Has cobbled together a workaround
4. Has budget (or can acquire it)
5. Has influence to champion adoption

**Acceptance Check:** You have a short list of earlyvangelists who will buy before the product is "ready."

## 8) Lexicon & Symbols

**Terms:**
1. **Customer Development** — The process of learning who customers are, what they need, and how to sell to them—run parallel to Product Development (§2)
2. **Product Development** — The process of building the product (engineering)—necessary but not sufficient (§1)
3. **Customer Discovery** — Step 1: Test hypotheses about customers and problems (§3)
4. **Customer Validation** — Step 2: Prove repeatable sales roadmap (§4)
5. **Customer Creation** — Step 3: Scale demand after validation (§5)
6. **Company Building** — Step 4: Transition from search to execution (§6)
7. **Market Type** — Existing, new, or resegmented—determines strategy (§2)
8. **Earlyvangelists** — Visionary early customers who feel the pain and will buy early (§3)
9. **Premature Scaling** — Scaling before validation; the leading cause of startup death (§1)
10. **Death Spiral** — Burn rate accelerates while learning lags; cash runs out (§1)
11. **Get Out of the Building** — The mantra: test assumptions with real customers, not opinions (§3)

**Symbols & Metaphors:**
1. **The Hero's Journey** — Startup founders as mythological heroes on a quest (§Preface)
2. **The Two Paths** — Path to Disaster (Product Development alone) vs. Path to Epiphany (Customer Development) (§1, §2)
3. **The Sibling** — Customer Development as the sibling to Product Development—neither complete alone (§2)
4. **The Building** — Where no facts exist; you must leave it to learn (§3)

## 9) Stance & Bounds

- **Startups are searching, not executing.** Treat early-stage work as hypothesis testing, not plan execution.
- **Get out of the building.** No assumptions are valid until tested with real customers.
- **Market type determines strategy.** The rules differ for existing, new, and resegmented markets.
- **Never scale before validation.** Premature scaling kills more startups than bad products.
- **Iterate, don't blame.** When hypotheses fail, pivot. Failure is learning.

**Where It Works:**
- Early-stage startups (pre-product-market fit)
- New product initiatives inside larger companies
- Any situation where customer and market are uncertain

**Where It's Less Applicable:**
- Established companies with known customers and proven models (execution mode)
- Pure technology research (where customer is distant)
- Post-PMF scaling (though Customer Creation and Company Building apply)
