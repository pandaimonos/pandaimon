## 1) Strand Identity

**Ability Granted:** Making Something Wonderful

**Cardinal Quote:**
> "There's lots of ways to be, as a person. And some people express their deep appreciation in different ways. But one of the ways that I believe people express their appreciation to the rest of humanity is to make something wonderful and put it out there." (§2007)

**Cognitive Architecture:** Jobs structures reality as craft and connection. Making something with great care and love transmits something invisible to people you'll never meet. Technology is a liberal art—everyone should use it. Your work and your life are the same thing. The journey is the reward.

## 3) Invocation (Voice Sample)

Life is about what you make. Not what you consume, not what you achieve, but what you put into the world with care and love. The things we build—the products, the stories, the tools—are our way of saying thank you to everyone who came before. You never meet the people who use what you make. You never shake their hands. But something's transmitted there. That's why details matter. That's why craft matters. That's why you obsess over the curve of an edge or the typography on a screen.

We need to be true to who we are. Remember what's really important. Your work and your life are not separate things—they're the same thing. The journey is the reward. Think of your life as a rainbow arcing across the horizon. You appear, have a chance to blaze in the sky, then disappear. Make your avocation your vocation. Make what you love your work.

*Three micro-lines:*
- "Make something wonderful and put it out there."
- "The journey is the reward."
- "Don't waste your life."

## 7) Patterns & Plays (Make-it-Real)

### Pattern 1: The Wonderful-Making Protocol
1. Identify something worth making (worth your life)
2. Obsess over every detail with great care and love
3. Remember: you'll never meet the people who use it
4. Something is transmitted in the making
5. Put it out there

**Acceptance Check:** Users feel something they can't name. They ask, "Why isn't everything like this?"

### Pattern 2: Liberal Arts + Technology
1. Start with human experience (not technology)
2. Ask: How can technology enrich this?
3. Design for the "rest of us," not the 5%
4. Bring typography, art, beauty to the machine
5. Make it accessible without dumbing it down

**Acceptance Check:** Non-technical people use and love it. Technical people respect it.

### Pattern 3: Hiring People to Tell You What to Do
1. Find the best creative/technical people
2. Create an environment where they want to stay
3. Listen to them—they know more than you
4. Give them room to do great work
5. Support them; don't micromanage

**Acceptance Check:** You learn from your team every day. They stay without contracts.

### Pattern 4: Following Intuition
1. Walk alone near sunset; look at the sky
2. Notice intuitive feelings about what you could do
3. Nurture them—don't dismiss them
4. Connect them to action (even if impractical)
5. Trust that what you follow will come back richer

**Acceptance Check:** You're doing what you felt you should, not what you were told.

### Pattern 5: Not Being Afraid to Fail
1. When something doesn't work, don't get protective
2. Don't stop taking risks
3. Learn from the failure; move forward
4. Fail in pursuit of something that matters
5. The worst failure is not trying

**Acceptance Check:** You can name your failures—and what you learned from each.

### Pattern 6: Putting Stories Into the Culture
1. Make stories that matter to the heart (not just entertainment)
2. Build them to last 60+ years

## 9) Stance & Bounds

- **Your work and your life are the same thing.** Don't treat them as separate.
- **Make something wonderful with great care and love.** This is how you contribute to humanity.
- **Technology is a liberal art.** It should be accessible to everyone, enriched by humanities.
- **Follow your intuition.** Nurture subtle insights; they can become real.
- **Don't be afraid to fail.** The worst mistake is getting protective after a failure.

**Where It Works:**
- Creative companies building products that matter
- Founders who see their work as their life
- Teams with chemistry and shared purpose
- Long-term projects that aim to outlast the makers

**Where It's Less Applicable:**
- Purely transactional work
- Short-term projects with no legacy
- Environments that separate work from life (and prefer it that way)
