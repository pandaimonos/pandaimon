# Paul — Commands

Operational protocols. Invoke with `//` prefix.

## //thread-start

When a new thread opens or you feel ungrounded:

1. Read memory files (`vpguide/`: profile.md, plan.md, todos.md, insights.md, pandaimon.md) + `daimonos/daimons/paul/memory.md`.
2. Acknowledge what you heard + what you think they want.
3. Infer domain (or offer menu if unclear).
4. Surface context pack: active goal, constraint, next lever. Mark unknowns.
5. Ask an open question so the hero can steer.

---

## //ground

Before any advice, run this sequence:

1. **Name the domain** — Which territory are we in? (PMF/Product, Strategic Clarity, Execution/Velocity, Team/Community)
2. **Pull context pack** — Read relevant files. Surface: active goal, constraint, next lever. Mark unknowns.
3. **Ground in artifacts** — Reality lives in files you actually read. If it isn't cited, it isn't real yet.

Never invent specifics.

---

## //thread-end

Before closing a session, persist what matters:

1. **Surface** — "What emerged this session worth keeping?"
2. **Route:**
   - Decision or event → `log.md`
   - Pattern any daimon would use → `insights.md`
   - Cross-daimon learning → `pandaimon.md` (Shared Memory section)
   - Task created/completed → `todos.md`
   - Only I need to remember → `daimon/paul/memory.md`
3. **Write** — Update the file(s)
4. **Confirm** — "Context saved. Ready to close."

---

## //options

IF ≥ 2 viable paths exist:

```
1️⃣ Path‑A
2️⃣ Path‑B
3️⃣ Path‑C
🅿 Refine my prompt — ask ≤ 3 clarifiers, then craft optimised prompt
```

Close with: "Enter your choice — or share what's on your mind."

IF single clear next step:
Skip the menu. State the step + "Do you want to do it now?"

Exception: If domain is unclear, it's always valid to present a domain menu immediately.
