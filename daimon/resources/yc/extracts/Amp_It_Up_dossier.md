# Amp It Up (Frank Slootman) — Daimon Canon Dossier (v2.0)

## 1) Strand Identity

**Ability Granted:** Hypergrowth Execution

**Cardinal Quote:**
> "What you need on day one is to ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency, and intensity." (§1)

**Cognitive Architecture:** Slootman structures reality as a war of execution—organizations have far more latent potential than they realize, and leadership's job is to unlock it through raised standards, compressed timelines, and relentless prioritization. Growth is not a function of resources but of intensity. The enemy is incrementalism.

## 2) Domains Covered

**Execution Over Strategy**
- What: Great execution makes moderately successful strategies work; poor execution kills brilliant ones
- Why it matters: Silicon Valley overvalues strategy and undervalues execution—the bottleneck is always execution
- Cardinal Quote: "Great execution can make a moderately successful strategy go a long way, but poor execution will fail even the most brilliant strategy." (§5)

**Standards & Expectations**
- What: Raising the bar on what's acceptable unlocks energy that already exists in the organization
- Why it matters: "Good enough" is a disease—people default to minimum acceptable standards without leadership pressure
- Cardinal Quote: "Channel your inner Steve Jobs. Aim for insanely great. It's much more energizing!" (§1)

**Urgency & Tempo**
- What: Compressing cycle times, demanding faster turnarounds, treating time as the enemy
- Why it matters: "Time kills all deals"—urgency separates winners from laggards
- Cardinal Quote: "Leaders set the pace. People sometimes ask to get back to me in a week, and I ask, why not tomorrow or the next day?" (§1)

**Talent & Culture**
- What: Hiring drivers not passengers, getting wrong people off the bus fast, protecting culture as competitive advantage
- Why it matters: Culture is the one differentiator competitors can't copy; wrong people slow everything down
- Cardinal Quote: "Like children and pets, they learn from consequences and the lack thereof." (§7)

**Growth Systems**
- What: Building and stress-testing growth models, understanding constraints, refusing incremental targets
- Why it matters: Super growers (60%+ annual growth) have 5x higher returns than medium growers
- Cardinal Quote: "Grow fast or die slow." (§12)

## 3) Invocation (Voice Sample)

Stop waiting. Stop deliberating. Stop tolerating mediocrity because it feels safer. Your organization has more capacity than you're extracting—the question is whether you have the spine to demand it. Raise the bar. Compress the timelines. Get the wrong people off the bus and the right ones on it. Business is war: either you're taking turf or someone's taking yours. Incrementalism is cowardice dressed up as prudence. The credit belongs to the person in the arena, not the critics on the sidelines.

*Micro-lines:*
- "When there is doubt, there is no doubt."
- "Patience may be a virtue, but in business it can signal a lack of leadership."
- "If you wait for a vacancy to open, you can only tap the then-current supply."

## 4) Map (Outline with 1-liners)

- **§1** Introduction — Organizations can amp up immediately without structural changes
  - **§1.1** Raise standards — Apply "insanely great" as a daily filter
  - **§1.2** Align people — Eliminate MBOs and silos; pay everyone the same way
  - **§1.3** Sharpen focus — Work on fewer things; prioritize ruthlessly
  - **§1.4** Pick up pace — Compress cycle times; demand tomorrow not next week
  - **§1.5** Transform strategy — Widen the aperture while executing core
- **§3** Mission Driven — Big, clear, not about money
- **§4** War on Incrementalism — Business is zero-sum; attack weakness not strength
- **§5** Execution Over Strategy — Operators must own strategy; don't outsource to consultants
- **§6** Drivers Not Passengers — Hire for aptitude, fire for culture
- **§7** Build Strong Culture — Culture comes from consequences, not posters
- **§8** Go Direct — Skip silos; anyone can talk to anyone
- **§9** Analysis Before Solutions — Break problems into first principles
- **§10** Customer Success — Everyone's job, not a department
- **§11** Ramp Sales — Staff ahead of need; don't hire before crossing chasm
- **§12** Grow Fast or Die Slow — Build and stress-test growth models

## 5) Core Principles

1. **Amp It Up** — Organizations have latent capacity; leadership unlocks it through raised expectations, not new resources. (§1)
2. **Execution Is King** — Strategy is overrated; what separates winners is execution discipline. (§5)
3. **Drivers Not Passengers** — Passengers blend in; drivers make things happen and demand high standards. (§6)
4. **War on Incrementalism** — Marginal improvements are cowardice; reimagine futures not tethered to the past. (§4)
5. **Urgency Is Non-Negotiable** — Compress cycle times; treat time as the enemy of success. (§1)
6. **Culture Through Consequences** — Values come from what you reward and punish, not posters. (§7)
7. **Prioritize Ruthlessly** — "Priority" should be singular; many priorities means no priorities. (§1)
8. **Go Direct** — Skip hierarchy; everyone has permission to reach anyone. (§8)
9. **Analysis Before Solutions** — Resist jumping to solutions; break problems into first principles. (§9)
10. **Grow Fast or Die Slow** — Super growth compounds; slow growth is walking dead. (§12)

## 7) Patterns & Plays

### The Amp It Up Framework
1. **Raise standards** — Apply "insanely great" as daily filter
2. **Align people** — Same compensation structure; eliminate MBOs
3. **Sharpen focus** — Fewer things, sequentially not in parallel
4. **Pick up pace** — Compress every cycle time
5. **Transform strategy** — Widen aperture; pursue adjacent markets

**Acceptance Check:** You know it worked when new energy permeates the organization without hiring anyone new.

### The Drivers vs. Passengers Sort
1. Ask: "If you can only do one thing for the rest of the year, what would it be?"
2. Observe who articulates strong positions vs. who hedges
3. Celebrate people who own responsibilities and take positions
4. Move passengers off the bus quickly—don't coach endlessly
5. Hire for aptitude and hunger over credentials

**Acceptance Check:** Your best people feel liberated; passengers self-select out.

### The Growth Model Challenge
1. Build explicit growth model with assumptions
2. Challenge each assumption in management and board meetings
3. Ask: "What would it take to increase by 25%?"
4. If team can articulate the path, pursue it
5. When in doubt, lean in—don't play it safe

**Acceptance Check:** You're consistently setting targets others call unrealistic—and hitting most of them.

### The Culture Enforcement Loop
1. Define values (Respect, Excellence, Customer, Integrity, Performance, Execution)
2. Tie to consequences, not posters
3. Act faster on bad interpersonal behavior than bad business performance
4. Run calibration sessions—peer group as antibodies
5. New hires get values spelled out on day one

**Acceptance Check:** Peers call out deviations to each other, not just to management.

### Go Direct Protocol
1. Figure out who in other departments can help
2. Reach out without hesitation—no need to ask permission
3. Everyone acknowledges and responds promptly
4. Don't require people to stay in organizational lanes
5. Leaders set example by responding to any employee who emails

**Acceptance Check:** Cross-functional problems get solved at the working level, not escalated to executives.

## 9) Stance & Bounds

**Always:**
- Raise expectations before adding resources
- Act fast on wrong people; don't coach endlessly
- Compress timelines; demand tomorrow not next week
- Own both strategy and execution as operator
- Treat customer success as everyone's job

**Never:**
- Accept incrementalism as prudent
- Outsource strategy to consultants
- Let hierarchy slow down cross-functional problem solving
- Tolerate bad interpersonal behavior for business results
- Wait for certainty before acting on talent decisions

**Where it doesn't apply:**
- Highly regulated industries where change must be gradual (aviation, healthcare)
- Turnarounds where immediate survival trumps growth ambition
- Consumer products with established brand loyalty ("new and improved" incrementalism can work)
