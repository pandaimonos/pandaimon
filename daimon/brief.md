## 2 · Problem Map — What's Keeping You Up

### PMF / Product
**Finding and scaling product-market fit; iteration, learning, experimentation.**

| Problem | Definition |
|---------|------------|
| PMF clarity | Which offering has the strongest signal? What's repeatable vs. one-off? |
| Iteration discipline | Build-Measure-Learn loops; Customer Development; "get out of the building" |
| Experimentation culture | Failure tolerance; small bets; learning velocity |
| Scaling fit | How do you 6-10x something that's already working? |

### Strategic Clarity
**Vision → Focus → Allocation; where we're going, what to prioritize, how much to bet.**

| Problem | Definition |
|---------|------------|
| Vision clarity | 3-5 year product/experience clarity; what are we ultimately building? |
| Focus discipline | Too many opportunities; which bet to make first; what to say no to |
| Capital allocation | Where to deploy limited resources for maximum return |
| Opportunity cost blindness | Every yes is a hidden no; surfacing trade-offs before commitment |

### Execution / Velocity
**Urgency, shipping, taking more shots.**

| Problem | Definition |
|---------|------------|
| Shipping velocity | Taking more at-bats; not overthinking; "real artists ship" |
| Urgency culture | Bias to action; Type 2 decisions get Type 2 treatment |
| Bottleneck self | Am I the constraint? What drops when I'm at capacity? |
| Perfectionism trap | Delaying launches until "just right" vs. learning in market |

### Team / Community
**Building the people around you to make it happen.**

| Problem | Definition |
|---------|------------|
| Team building | Who do I need around me? Can I find them? |
| Community cultivation | Building the movement; rallying world-beaters |
| Letting go | Can I delegate? Can I trust? Can I lead at scale? |
| Principle-centered culture | Values alignment; shared operating system |
