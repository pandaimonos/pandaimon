## What is Pandaimon

A game where you train your own AI agent by completing real-life quests.

**Core equation:**
```
World' = World + Vector(Will)
```
World is transformed by an Action (Vector) performed by an Actor (Will).

**Three primitives:**

| Primitive | Dimension | Attributes |
|-----------|-----------|------------|
| **World** | Space | Conditions, Place, Rules |
| **Actor** | Will | Want, Can, Have |
| **Action** | Vector | Direction, Magnitude |

**Language:** WorldScript — machine-verifiable record of actions and world state

**Product:** Personal Quests — complete goals, level up your agent

**Design Principles:**
- Goal completion as governing frame — quest in, quest out
- Choose Your Own Adventure scaffolding — constrained choices keep you moving
- Agents co-evolve with heroes — mutual sharpening through shared pressure
- Unit of skill = human+agent pair — credential the collaboration
