## Overview

A guide for people new to startups, distilled from Y Combinator's accumulated advice. Covers how to start a startup (Part II forthcoming on scaling).

**Core Thesis:** Your goal as a startup is to make something users love. If you do that, figure out how to get more users. If you fail at the first part, you will fail.

## Part I: The Idea

### The Essential Questions

1. **What are you building and why?** — Need clear, concise answers. This reflects both founder clarity and idea quality.
2. **Who desperately needs this?** — Best case: you're the target user. Second best: you understand them deeply.
3. **Do users love it?** — Measured by unprompted sharing, not survey responses. For consumer: launch and observe. For enterprise: get letter of intent before building.

### Testing & Evolution

- Work backward from perfect experience to find minimum viable kernel
- Let idea evolve with user feedback
- Understand users deeply—essential for evaluation, product, and company building

### Why You're Starting This Company

- Founders need shared sense of mission to sustain through difficulty
- Startups take long time + consistent intense effort

### How It Becomes a Monopoly

- Businesses that get more powerful with scale
- Difficult to copy
- Ethical execution (not unethical competitive behavior)

### The Market

- How big is it today?
- How fast is it growing?
- Why will it be big in 10 years?
- Best answer: going after large part of a small market
- Timing matters: major technological shifts most people haven't noticed yet favor startups

### Idea Selection Principles

**Prefer something new** — 10x better is an acceptable definition of "new." If ten other companies are starting with the same plan, skepticism is warranted.

**Why new > derivative:** Easier to recruit and build something genuinely new than derivative/easy. People want to help with the former; they won't for the latter.

**Best ideas sound bad:** Don't be overly secretive. If it's good, it won't sound worth stealing. A thousand times more people have good ideas than will do the work to build them. Tell people—they might help.

### Dealing with Criticism

- Almost everyone will tell you your idea sucks
- They might be right, or bad at evaluating startups, or jealous
- It will hurt and affect you even if you think it won't
- Develop self-belief fast; haters never go away no matter your success

### Forcing Ideas vs. Organic Discovery

**Don't force it.** Y Combinator tried funding promising teams with no ideas—all failed.

Instead:
- Learn about many different things
- Practice noticing problems, inefficiencies, major tech shifts
- Work on interesting projects
- Spend time around smart people
- Ideas will emerge

### The Pivot Trap

Once you have an official startup, you feel pressure to hurry into an idea. The idea can't be too crazy. Result: plausible but derivative ideas.

## Part II: A Great Team

### The Strength of Founders

- One of the most important things YC evaluates
- Mediocre teams do not build great companies
- Later-stage investing is more about the market; early-stage is about the founders

### Early Hiring Principles

- Hire people smarter than you and stronger than you
- Find people who complement your weaknesses
- Early employees set culture and often become important long-term
- Hire for mission fit, not just skill fit

### Recruiting Strategy

- For early stage: mission and founder strength matter most, not money
- Best people want to work on something meaningful
- Network and personal relationships are crucial
- Spend significant time recruiting; it's that important

### Management Essentials

- **Don't go into hero mode** — Most first-time managers try to do everything themselves, become unavailable to staff, end in meltdown. Resist this temptation; be willing to be late on projects to maintain functioning team.
- **Location matters** — Nearly all most successful startups started with team in same office. Remote work may work for larger companies but not recipe for massive startup success.
- **Fire quickly** — Everyone knows this in principle; almost no one does it. Also fire toxic culture members regardless of ability. Culture is defined by who you hire, fire, and promote.

## Part IV: Execution — Competitors

**Competitors are a startup ghost story.** 99% of startups die from suicide (internal failure), not murder (competition).

**Worry about internal problems, not competitors.**

99% of the time, ignore competitors—especially when they raise money or make press noise. Do not worry until they have real, shipped product beating you.

Press releases are easier than code; code is easier than great product.

**Henry Ford:** "The competitor to be feared is one who never bothers about you at all, but goes on making his own business better all the time."

Every giant company faced worse threats when small and came out ok. There's always a counter-move.

## Part IV: Execution — Making Money

**Short version:** Get people to pay you more than it costs to deliver.

### For Free Products
- Don't plan to grow by buying users (hard for ad-supported)
- Make something people share with friends

### For Paid Products (LTV < $500)
- Generally cannot afford direct sales
- Experiment: SEO/SEM, ads, mailings, etc.
- Try to repay customer acquisition cost (CAC) in 3 months

### For Paid Products (LTV > $500)
- Can generally afford direct sales
- Try selling yourself first to learn what works
- Reference: *Hacking Sales*

### Universal Goal
- Get to "ramen profitability" as quickly as possible
- Once there: control your own destiny, no longer at whims of investors
- Watch cash flow obsessively (founders have run out of money without knowing)

---

## Part IV: Execution — Fundraising

### When to Raise

- When you need it or when it's available on good terms
- Be careful not to lose frugality or solve problems by throwing money at them
- Not enough money: bad. Too much money: almost always bad.

### The Secret

**Have a good company.** Everything else founders optimize probably matters ~5% of the time.

Investors seek companies that will be really successful *whether or not they invest* but can grow faster with capital.

Investors fear missing the next Google AND losing money on something obviously stupid. (Best companies inspire both fears simultaneously.)

### Investor Psychology

- Driven by dual fears, not by perfect data
- They prefer metrics over their own judgment
- Most don't know most industries
- Still (mostly) require warm introductions
- When they say "no," believe the no but not the reason
- Anything but explicit "yes" is a "no" (investors say "no" sounding like "maybe yes")

### Fundraising Strategy

- **Parallel conversations** — Don't go sequentially through favorites. Run parallel paths; fear of missing opportunity motivates investors to act.
- **First check is hardest** — Focus on whoever loves you most
- **Multiple plans** — Always have plan that doesn't involve raising anything
- **Be flexible** — Open to more capital if you can deploy it and terms are reasonable

### Fundraising Mechanics

- It's a necessary evil; get it done quickly
- Don't fall in love with fundraising (always bad)
- Have one founder do it so company doesn't grind to halt
- Clean terms important (complications compound); don't over-optimize valuation
- Intermediate valuations don't matter much

### Pitching

- Clear, easy-to-understand story is key (but having a good company is most important)
- Minimum pitch includes: mission, problem, product/service, business model, team, market + growth rate, financials
- Bar gets higher each round (seed presenter ≠ Series A presenter)

### Choosing Investors

- Good investors add significant value; bad ones detract significantly; most are neutral
- Small check investors usually do nothing for you (beware party rounds)
- Great board members are one of best external forcing functions
- Willing to accept lower valuation for involved, valuable board member

## Closing Thought

**A thousand people have every great idea. One becomes successful.**

The difference is execution. It's a grind. No shortcut exists from idea to success.

You need:
1. Great idea
2. Great team
3. Great product
4. Great execution

So easy! ;)
