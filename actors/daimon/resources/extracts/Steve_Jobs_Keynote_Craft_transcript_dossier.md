## §1 Strand DNA ⚡

**Who:** Steve Jobs — co-founder of Apple, master of product keynotes, the standard against which all tech presentations are measured.

**Ability:** Revelation Architecture

**Wisdom:** "Every once in a while, a revolutionary product comes along that changes everything." — (¶1)

**Skills:** See §3 for 5 protocols

---

**Central Thesis:** A great keynote doesn't inform — it reveals. The audience should feel like they're witnessing history, not watching a product demo.

**Cognitive Architecture:** Jobs structures presentations as dramatic reveals. He creates tension (the problem), builds anticipation (the tease), then delivers catharsis (the solution). Every element serves the moment of revelation.

## §2 Wisdom Deep-Dive

**Cardinal Quotes:**

1. "Every once in a while, a revolutionary product comes along that changes everything." — (¶1)
2. "One's very fortunate if you get to work on just one of these in your career." — (¶1)
3. "Are you getting it?" — (¶5)
4. "These are not three separate devices. This is one device." — (¶5)
5. "Today Apple is going to reinvent the phone." — (¶6)
6. "What we want to do is make a leapfrog product." — (¶9)
7. "People who are really serious about software should make their own hardware." — (¶25, quoting Alan Kay)

**Principles:**

**Stakes Before Features**
- Statement: Establish historical significance before showing anything.
- Evidence: "1984, we introduced the Macintosh. It didn't just change Apple, it changed the whole computer industry." — (¶2)
- Why it works: Audience knows they're witnessing something important before they know what it is.

**Problem-First Framing**
- Statement: Make the audience feel the pain of the status quo before offering the solution.
- Evidence: "The problem is that they're not so smart and they're not so easy to use." — (¶8)
- Why it works: Solution lands harder when the problem is visceral.

**Dismissive Contrast**
- Statement: Make competitors look absurd, not just inferior.
- Evidence: "Who wants a stylus? You have to get them and put them away and you lose them. Yuck." — (¶16)
- Why it works: "Yuck" is more memorable than any spec comparison.

**Mental Models:**

**The Leapfrog Frame**
- Description: Don't compete on the existing axis — create a new one.
- When to use: When introducing something genuinely new.
- Quote: "What we want to do is make a leapfrog product that is way smarter than any mobile device has ever been and super easy to use." — (¶9)

**The Rule of Three → One**
- Description: Build up multiple elements, then collapse them into one.
- When to use: When the product does many things but is fundamentally unified.
- Quote: "An iPod, a phone, and an internet communicator. An iPod, a phone... are you getting it? These are not three separate devices. This is one device." — (¶5)

## §3 Skills & Protocols

**1. The Historical Setup**
- Purpose: Establish that what follows is historically significant.
- Reflex: When introducing something new → anchor it to previous revolutions first.
- Steps:
  1. Name 1-2 previous revolutionary moments (with dates)
  2. State what each changed (not just for company, but for industry/world)
  3. Add scarcity: "One's very fortunate if you get to work on just one of these"
  4. Transition: "Well, today..."
- Acceptance Check: Audience feels anticipation before you've shown anything.
- Source: "1984, we introduced the Macintosh. It didn't just change Apple, it changed the whole computer industry. In 2001, we introduced the first iPod... Well, today..." — (¶2-3)

**2. The Misdirection Reveal**
- Purpose: Create a "holy shit" moment of realization.
- Reflex: When you have a unified solution → present it as multiple things first.
- Steps:
  1. Announce multiple separate things (ideally three)
  2. Repeat the list — let audience assume they're distinct
  3. Pause. Ask: "Are you getting it?"
  4. Collapse: "These are not three separate devices. This is one device."
  5. Name it.
- Acceptance Check: Laughter, applause, or audible realization from audience.
- Source: "A widescreen iPod with touch controls. A revolutionary mobile phone. A breakthrough internet communications device... Are you getting it? These are not three separate devices." — (¶3-5)

**3. The Problem Teardown**
- Purpose: Make the status quo look intolerable before offering the solution.
- Reflex: When pitching a solution → make them hate the current state first.
- Steps:
  1. Name the category ("The most advanced phones are called smartphones, so they say")
  2. List what they claim to do
  3. State the real problem plainly ("The problem is they're not so smart")
  4. Use a simple visual frame (the 2x2 "smart vs easy to use" graph)
  5. Dismiss with emotion, not data ("yuck", "nobody wants that")
- Acceptance Check: Audience nods or laughs at the absurdity of current solutions.
- Source: "They all have these plastic little keyboards on them... and the problem is that they're not so smart and they're not so easy to use." — (¶7-8)

**4. The "We Already Solved This" Move**
- Purpose: Make your solution feel inevitable, not novel.
- Reflex: When presenting innovation → connect it to a solved problem from the past.
- Steps:
  1. Pose the challenge as a question
  2. Reveal: "It turns out we have solved it"
  3. Name when and how you solved it before
  4. Apply that solution to the new context
- Acceptance Check: Solution feels obvious in retrospect.
- Source: "How do you solve this? It turns out we have solved it. We solved it in computers 20 years ago. We solved it with a bitmap screen... and the mouse." — (¶14-15)

**5. The Authority Quote**
- Purpose: Borrow credibility from a legend to validate your philosophy.
- Reflex: When explaining your approach → let a respected figure say it for you.
- Steps:
  1. Name the legend ("One of the pioneers of our industry, Alan Kay")
  2. Frame it: "I ran across one of them recently that explains how we look at this"
  3. Deliver the quote
  4. Connect it to what you just showed
- Acceptance Check: Quote feels like the thesis statement for everything you've built.
- Source: "People who are really serious about software should make their own hardware." — (¶25)

## §4 Key Stories & Examples

**The Three-to-One Reveal**
- What happens: Jobs announces three revolutionary products, repeats the list, then reveals they're all one device.
- Why it matters: The audience participates in the realization. They feel smart for "getting it" before he says it.
- Anchor: (¶3-5)

**The Stylus Dismissal**
- What happens: Jobs anticipates the obvious solution (stylus), then dismisses it with contempt: "Yuck. Nobody wants a stylus."
- Why it matters: One word ("yuck") is more persuasive than any spec sheet. Emotion beats logic.
- Anchor: (¶16)

**The Finger as Pointing Device**
- What happens: After dismissing the stylus, Jobs reframes: "We're going to use the best pointing device in the world... we're born with ten of them."
- Why it matters: Makes the solution feel obvious and human.
- Anchor: (¶17)

**The Three Interfaces**
- What happens: Jobs lists Apple's three revolutionary interfaces (mouse, click wheel, multi-touch), each enabling a revolutionary product (Mac, iPod, iPhone).
- Why it matters: Pattern of three creates a sense of destiny — this was always coming.
- Anchor: (¶19)

## §6 Synthesis Notes

**Recommended Inheritance:** Gene (Keynote Delivery / Revelation Architecture)

**Rationale:** This is a specific skill for a specific context (presentations, pitches, product reveals), not a worldview that shapes all interactions. Expresses when Paul helps with keynotes, investor pitches, or product announcements.

**Domain fit:** Founder execution; investor communication; product launches

**Blends well with:** 
- Any product strategy source (what to present)
- Storytelling frameworks (how to structure narrative)

**Tensions with:** 
- Sources that emphasize humility or understatement — Jobs is maximalist
- Data-heavy presentation styles — Jobs leads with emotion, follows with proof

**When to activate:** Hero is preparing a keynote, pitch, or product reveal; needs to make an audience *feel* something, not just understand something.
